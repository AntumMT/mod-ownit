## Ownit: Node Ownership

### Description:

A tool for setting or removing ownership of a node. Ownership is determined by the "owner" attribute in the node's meta data. In order for this to actually be effective, other mods must respect that attribute. Otherwise, setting the owner does nothing.

One instance where this tool is useful is in cases where a player wants to unown a door so others can use it freely.

In future versions, setting ownership will only be possible in protected areas where the player using the wand is the owner.

### Usage:

Simply use the wand on a node to own or unown it. Nodes already owned by other players cannot be hijacked.
